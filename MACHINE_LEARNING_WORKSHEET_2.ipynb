Thus, k - means becomesa great solution for clustering and reducing the space into disjoint smaller sub-spaces where other clustering algorithms can be applied. K-means is the simplest to implement and to run. It works really well with large datasets. It is one of the most robust methods, especially for image segmentation and image annotation projects. For straightforward clustering, it is also a part of a larger data-processing pipeline, K-means is a reasonable default choice Hence, it is the most popular clustering algorithm. "

    "ANS. No, K- means is based on a non-deterministic algorithm. This means that running the algorithm several times on the same data, could give different results. The non-deterministic nature of K-Means is due to its random selection of data points as initial centroids. Method: We propose an improved, density based version of K-Means, which involves a novel and systematic method for selecting initial centroids. Thus, k-means is a partitioning-based clustering algorithm.This method for clustering is an iterative process in which an initial partition of given k clusters is then improved by applying a search algorithm to the data."
