An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant. In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis. The proper use of ANOVA in analyzing survey data requires that a few assumptions be met including normal distribution of data; independence of cases, and equality of variance (each group’s variance is equal). If these assumptions cannot be met then there are non-parametric tests available which do not require these assumptions."
