    "#### Table Explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "     The movie table contains information about each movie. There are text descriptions such as title and overview. Some \n",
    "      fields are more obvious than others: revenue (the amount of money the movie made), budget (the amount spent on \n",
    "      creating the movie). Other fields are calculated based on data used to create the data source: popularity, votes_avg, \n",
    "      and votes_count. The status indicates if the movie is Released, Rumoured, or in Post-Production.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The country list contains a list of different countries, and the movie_country table contains a record of which \n",
    "      countries a movie was filmed in (because some movies are filmed in multiple countries). This is a standard many-to-\n",
    "      many table, and you’ll find these in a lot of databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The same concept applies to the production_company table. There is a list of production companies and a many-to-\n",
    "      many relationship with movies which is captured in the movie_company table.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The languages table has a list of languages, and the movie_languages captures a list of languages in a movie. \n",
    "      The difference with this structure is the addition of a language_role table. \n",
    "\n",
    "     This language_role table contains two records: Original and Spoken. A movie can have an original language (e.g. \n",
    "      English), but many Spoken languages. This is captured in the movie_languages table along with a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Genres define which category a movie fits into, such as Comedy or Horror. A movie can have multiple genres, which is \n",
    "      why the movie_genres table exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The same concept applies to keywords, but there are a lot more keywords than genres. I’m not sure what qualifies as \n",
    "      a keyword, but you can explore the data and take a look. Some examples as “paris”, “gunslinger”, or “saving the \n",
    "      world”.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The cast and crew section of the database is a little more complicated. Actors, actresses, and crew members are \n",
    "      all people, playing different roles in a movie. Rather than have separate lists of names for crew and cast, this \n",
    "      database contains a table called person, which has each person’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The movie_cast table contains records of each person in a movie as a cast member. It has their character name, along \n",
    "      with the cast_order, which I believe indicates that lower numbers appear higher on the cast list.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The movie_cast table also links to the gender table, to indicate the gender of each character. The gender is linked to\n",
    "      the movie_cast table rather than the person table to cater for characters which may be a different gender than the \n",
    "      person, or characters of unknown gender. This means that there is no gender table linked to the person table, but \n",
    "      that’s because of the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "     The movie_crew table follows a similar concept and stores all crew members for all movies. Each crew member has a \n",
    "      job, which is part of a department (e.g. Camera)."
