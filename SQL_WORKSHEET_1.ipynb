Another feature of time-variance is that once data is stored in the data warehouse then it cannot be modified, alter, or updated."

Every dimension in a star schema is represented with the only one-dimension table and the dimension table should contain the set of attributes and is joined to the fact table using a foreign key. Hence, the dimension table are not joined to each other. "

SETL not only has extensive provision for programming with sets but also takes advantage of the syntactic tradition of abstract mathematics, the language's notation being very close to the one of set theory, thus making it possible to express many algorithms in a familiar, natural, and concise manner. SETL programs are much more declarative than procedural. The primitive datatypes of SETL include integer, floating-point, Boolean, atom, and string. Integers are of unlimited magnitude. Both sets and ordered sets (called tuples) are heterogeneous in SETL: values of all sorts can be members of the same structure, including other sets and tuples."
